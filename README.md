# Examples of emulation with Alice & Bob's Qiskit provider

This repository contains examples of local emulations of various types of
quantum processor architectures, using [Alice & Bob's Qiskit provider](https://github.com/Alice-Bob-SW/qiskit-alice-bob-provider).

To install dependencies and run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

We recommend to install dependencies in a virtual environment to avoid
messing your system-wide Python installation:

```
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m jupyter notebook
```
